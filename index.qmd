# Welcome !


I am Maxime Fosset, an Intensive Care Medicine resident at Montpellier Teaching Hospital and a PhD student in Biostatistics and Causal Inference at the University of Montpellier. I am a member of the [PreMeDICal Team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/), a joint initiative between INRIA and INSERM, dedicated to advancing precision medicine methods through causal learning and federated learning. 

My research focuses on emulating target trials on observational databases and utilizing modern machine learning techniques to quantify treatment effects. I am also particularly interested in the development of causal inference methods for mechanical ventilation research.
On this website, you will find my publications, ongoing research and recommended resources to explore the fields of causal inference and intensive care medicine.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:max.fosset@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
